        <h1 id="understanding-platos-republic---e1">Understanding Plato&rsquo;s Republic - E1</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This the first episode in (hopefully) a series of several articles where I narrate my own understanding of <em>Plato&rsquo;s Republic</em>. In this episode, I discuss about the very initial parts of chapter 1 of the book. While Socrates&rsquo; dialogues contain a lot of different characters much like a play, the exact names of them are not so important to take note of except for a few prominent figures that play a crucial role in Socrates&rsquo; arguments. In this article, I give an overview of what transpires before Thrasymachus, the most vocal and prominent interlocutor of Socrates in chapter 1, starts engaging with Socrates.</p>
<h2 id="part-1-hows-life-old-fella">Part 1: How&rsquo;s Life, Old Fella?</h2>
<p>In this part, the stage is being set up for what is to come. Socrates meets a wealthy but somewhat wise old man by the name of Cephalus, and their conversation roughly goes as follows.</p>
<p><strong>Socrates</strong>: Yo, what&rsquo;s up, old man? How&rsquo;s life?<br>
<strong>Cephalus</strong>: Good if you&rsquo;re good and bad if you&rsquo;re bad, son.<br>
<strong>Socrates</strong>: You sure it&rsquo;s not &ldquo;Good if you&rsquo;re rich and bad if you&rsquo;re poor&rdquo;?<br>
<strong>Cephalus</strong>: OK, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;Good if you&rsquo;re good and rich, but bad if you&rsquo;re bad or poor&rdquo;. So even if you&rsquo;re rich, you won&rsquo;t have a good life - you gotta have <em>good character</em> yourself.<br>
<strong>Socrates</strong>: But my g, what is <em>good character</em>? What is <em>good</em>?</p>
<p>So basically Socrates asks Cephalus how he is doing, and Cephalus replies that he&rsquo;s doing good. Socrates then asks him why it is that many people find old age unbearable. Cephalus says that those enslaved by their desires will have a rough time being old, but those who are sensible will not. Socrates again asks if Cephalus&rsquo; wellbeing was not due to his wealth. Cephalus says that you can have all the wealth in the world but that will not bring you peace if you yourself are not good. That leads us to the central question of the book: <strong><em>What is good? What is just?</em></strong> At this point, Cephalus, like a chad, says that it is <em>giving everyone their due</em>, refuses to elaborate and lets Polemarchus continue the talk, and goes home.</p>
<h3 id="quotes-to-mull-over">Quotes to Mull Over</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I enjoy talking to very old men, for they have gone before us, as it were, on a road that we too may have to tread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted --><em>Socrates</em><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;in old age you become quite free of feelings of this sort and they leave you in peace; and when your desires lose their intensity and relax, you get &hellip;a release from a lot of mad masters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted --><em>Cephalus</em><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;For if men are sensible and good-tempered, old age is easy enough to bear; if not, youth as well as age is a burden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted --><em>Cephalus</em><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="part-2-just-clear-your-dues">Part 2: Just Clear Your Dues!</h2>
<p>At this point, Socrates&rsquo; conversation delves into philosophical waters and continues with Polemarchus and Socrates scrutinising Cephalus&rsquo; definition of justice. Their conversation sorta sounds like this: a mad landlord goes to his tenant for collecting a long overdue rent. The tenant being a philosopher successfully leaves the landlord struggling to latch onto what&rsquo;s what.</p>
<p><strong>Landlord (Polemarchus)</strong>: Socrates, the just man gives everyone what is their due.<br>
<strong>Socrates</strong>: But, dear sir, what is &ldquo;due&rdquo;?<br>
<strong>Landlord</strong>: It is giving what is appropriate to each person.<br>
<strong>Socrates</strong>: But, good sir, what exactly is appropriate to each person?<br>
<strong>Landlord</strong>: Benefitting friends, and harming enemies.<br>
<strong>Socrates</strong>: When you ask for my rent you certainly sound like an enemy, dear sir. But where are we to do this benefit and harm? And who&rsquo;s a friend, who&rsquo;s an enemy? How do I tell if my judgment of friend and enemy is correct?<br>
<strong>Landlord</strong>: Um&hellip; Okay maybe it&rsquo;s &ldquo;benefitting your friend if he&rsquo;s good, and harming your enemy if he&rsquo;s evil.&rdquo;<br>
<strong>Socrates</strong>: Ya sure about that fam? Ya sure a just man would harm <em>anyone</em>?<br>
<strong>Landlord</strong>: Why not?<br>
<strong>Socrates</strong>: Well maybe, let&rsquo;s say, harming someone makes them more unjust, you know? And justice shouldn&rsquo;t give birth to more injustice, so&hellip; Maybe the just man shouldn&rsquo;t harm <em>anyone</em>, period.<br>
<strong>Landlord</strong>: Not sure if I get your point but pretty sure this means you gotta pay me whether I&rsquo;m your enemy or not, my guy.</p>
<p>So in this part Socrates starts by asking Polemarchus what he means by &ldquo;dues&rdquo;. Polemarchus, after a little touring, settles on &ldquo;helping friends, harming enemies&rdquo;. Socrates then asks in which context must a just man do this help and harm. Polemarchus says that it is in war, to which Socrates replies whether justice is useful in peacetime. Polemarchus says that it is useful in peacetime during transactions, e.g. keeping somebody&rsquo;s money safe.</p>
<p>Socrates at this point, in a move of very questionable logical validity, says that whoever can best keep it safe can also best steal it, therefore justice must be a sort of theft. The issue lies in both the premise and the conclusion. The premise definitely does not hold true, because, for example, a man may have the most advanced safe in the whole world which no thief in the world could crack. That would certainly make him the most skilled person at keeping things safe, but that certainly doesn&rsquo;t endow him with any skills whatsoever of stealing. Even if we do allow the premise to be true, the conclusion doesn&rsquo;t necessarily follow, since, for example, a schoolteacher, although he has the ability to ace the tests he gives his students, he himself is not a student. Having the ability to do something doesn&rsquo;t necessarily imply that one <em>does</em> do that thing.</p>
<p>And then Socrates goes on to confuse Polemarchus even further -  asking him whether a truly just man would harm <em>anyone</em>. He argues that harming anyone renders them less capable of justice and hence more unjust. What is just cannot produce more of unjust, so it must be that a just man <em>does not harm anyone</em>.</p>
<p>By this point in the conversation, Socrates has Polemarchus convinced that his original view of justice (benefitting friends and harming enemies) must be incorrect.</p>
