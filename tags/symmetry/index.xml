      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;using-symmetry-to-expose-the-fraud-poster-child-of-economics&#34;&gt;Using Symmetry to Expose the Fraud Poster Child of Economics&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whenever we hear of the term &amp;ldquo;economics&amp;rdquo;, the first picture that comes to mind is that of money. The second picture, if you&amp;rsquo;ve been put through at least some sort of formal economic education as in high schools, is the famous supply-and-demand curves. They&amp;rsquo;re the ubiquitous poster-child of the field of economics, the same as $E = mc^2$ or the apocryphal &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;apple falling on Sir Isaac&amp;rsquo;s head&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; in the field of physics. Despite the provocative title, I know and appreciate these models within their scope of usage, and the intent of this essay remains more mathematical than economical. As a noneconomist, I don&amp;rsquo;t really know how much they&amp;rsquo;re used in advanced economic work, but in public discourse of economic policymaking, they have proven so far to be invaluable assets, shedding light on everything starting from local egg prices and the exchange rates in a forex market to economic policymaking on a global level. Yet its mathematical underpinnings seem woefully underexplored. This essay will be an outsider&amp;rsquo;s journey into attempting to formalize the immensely influential yet rather nebulous hand-wavy tools. The goal is, at the very least, to serve as a good demo of how simple mathematical principles and &amp;ldquo;gut feelings&amp;rdquo;, pursued with determination, can lead to delightfully pleasant results. My starting point into the attack will be to a simple and seemingly reasonable hypothesis: &lt;em&gt;the supply curve can be viewed as a demand curve for money from the seller&amp;rsquo;s perspective&lt;/em&gt;. But first, let&amp;rsquo;s review a bit about the classical model and see where it shines rather dazzlingly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
