      <title>The Ontological Status of Time - Preliminary Thoughts</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-a-clock&#34;&gt;What is a Clock?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A philosopher and a physicist walk into a cafe. The philosopher asks the physicist to define &amp;ldquo;time&amp;rdquo;. The physicist says,&amp;ldquo;simple - &lt;em&gt;that which is measured by a clock&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;Cool, but &lt;em&gt;what is a frickin clock?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;, replies the exasperated philosopher. (The real fun, however, happens when both of them are the same person.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This post is not to discuss my thoughts on time in an elaborate manner. I&amp;rsquo;ll defer that to a later time when I feel that my ideas have reached their ultimate form. But for now, I&amp;rsquo;d like to drop some hints. I&amp;rsquo;m, for the time being (pun intended and very much apt), a presentist. If I find at some point that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit the data, I&amp;rsquo;ll drop it. No attachments to it, I just want to see which hypothesis works better. The time hypothesis doesn&amp;rsquo;t, as I want to make plausible in what follows.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;god-epistemology-and-ontology&#34;&gt;God: Epistemology and Ontology&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The following includes my first thoughts while reading &lt;em&gt;An Introduction to the Philosophy of Religion&lt;/em&gt; by Murray and Rea, largely unfiltered. This is the first part of my collected thoughts on chapter 1, in which rather than discussing directly what has been talked about in the chapter itself, I have written down my perspectives on how to go about solving the epistemological and metaphysical problems associated with the question of God. In the next part, in shaa Allah, I will write about what exactly has been discussed in the chapter and how that fits (or does not) with my framework captured below.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Everywhere Yet Nowhere: The Ontological Status of Energy</title>
      <link>https://susmit31.github.io/entropic-legos/posts/energy-ontology/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;energy-is-everywhere-or-is-it&#34;&gt;Energy is Everywhere. Or Is It?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We love energy. Our civilisation is built on energy. Each phase in the history of the human civilisation is marked by inventing some radically more efficient way to extract energy from some &amp;ldquo;stored form&amp;rdquo;. From eating fruits and veggies storing energy obtained from the sun to burning the carcasses of them to smashing subatomic particles off of each other, we&amp;rsquo;ve certainly come a long way. We can extract energy &amp;ldquo;hidden&amp;rdquo; in even the remotest corner of the smallest conceivable energy storage - an atom. And with all this energy we power our homes, our offices, our factories, and most importantly, our electronic appliances, including the one we&amp;rsquo;re reading/writing this post on. But &lt;em&gt;what exactly&lt;/em&gt; is energy?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
